## Revision

* Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”:

Redux Ducks is a modular pattern that collocates actions, action types and reducers. Its unopinionated; it lets us decide everything from store set-up and its contents to reducers. This provides great set up flexibility as per the project requirements, but this flexibility is not always needed. The down side to it is that we have to figure out the architecture ourselves, which is not an easy task.

Redux toolkit provides an opinionated wrapper around redux and lets us do more with less code.

* What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?

That its opinionated, which makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code.

## Terms Documentation

* **redux toolkit slices**:

a higher order function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions and a slice name. It automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

* **namespace**:

a set of names that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds

## Preview - React Native

**React Native** is an open-source UI software framework used to develop native applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities.

React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing native teams work much faster.

**Expo** is a tool built on top of React Native used to embed and run React Native projects and share how they render in platforms like Android and iOS.
