[SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained with few Example DB](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

* Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| Name           | Link  |
| -----------    | ----------- |
| Table based | Document based |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Predefined schema | Dynamic schema |
| Uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating data | Uses UnQL (Unstructured Query Language), in which queries are focused on a collection of documents |
| Good fit for the complex query intensive environment | Not good fit for complex queries |


* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Highly structured, non-hierarchical data.

* Give a real world example.

Oracle Express Edition.

* What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Unstructured hierarchical data storage.

* Give a real world example.

MongoDB.

* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL databases.

* Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL databases.

* What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language.

* What is a relational database?

It is a type of database that uses a structure to identify and access a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data.

* What type of structure does a relational database work with?

A table (columns, rows), or schemas.

* What is a ‘schema’?

It is an abstract design that represents the storage of data in a database. An SQL database schema represents which data can go into the relational database table.

* What is a NoSQL database?

Not SQL or Not Only SQL - non-tabular databases that store data differently than relational databases.

* How does it work?

It has collections (~ a table in SQL). Collections store data records as documents (~ a row in SQL). Documents don't have to use the same schema.

* What is inside of a Mongo database?

Collections and documents that contain data.

* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB, because it has no schema it can hold different documents in the same collection. So you can add more data, and it doesn't relay on relations.

* What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

Since it has less relations, so duplicate data must be changed separately.
