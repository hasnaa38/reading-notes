This repository is created for 102d36 - Lab 01b. In this file, I will use the markdown language to summarize [this blog article](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) that discusses the concept of growth mindset.

### Two contradictory mindsets 
There are two main mindsets to navigate life:  
- **The fixed mindset** - it is believing that one's qualities and talents are inherent and can't be changed. People who use this mindset tie themselves from doing anything they are not already good at; therefore, they tie themselves from reaching their full potential.  
- **The growth mindset** - it is believing that anyone can do anything as long as they put the time and effort to learn and developed their abilities. People who aim to achieve their goals and become successful should be using this mindset.
The image below shows the difference between the two.

### The growth mindset 
If you are having a growth mindset, you will have following: 
1. **Challenges** - Challenges are a way help you grow and expand your knowledge, so when you face one -and you will-, don't give up. Take a step back, relax, reevaluate the problem and try to find another way around to work it out.   
2. **Obstacles** - If there were any obstacles standing in your way from reaching the end goal -whether its short term or long-term goal-, fix them! The article suggested two methods: relaxing for a bet and getting back when you are inspired -if it was possible- and splitting the work into smaller chunks and jumping between them. 
3. **Effort** - No pain, no gain! Do everything you can and more, challenge yourself, and remember that hard work always pays off. 
4. **Criticism** - Be open minded and receive constructive criticism from other grace. Also, criticize your own work and be proud of the good aspect of it and improve the others. 
5. **Success of others** - Be a genuine human being and don't waste your time and energy looking into other people lives. 

### Reminders to myself 
While reading the article, I relied that I stand in the middle of both mindsets, so I decided to pause for couple minutes, think, and I came up with the following tips and reminders for myself to be able to get closer to the growth mindset side: 
1. There is no "right time" to start a new chapter.   
2. Find inspiration and motivation. 
3. Stay focused and stop procrastinating. The author and I suffer from the same obstacle, which he described as: 
> I lose focus, just like it says in the chart above. Whether itâ€™s clicking a tempting bookmark in my browser, nipping out to grab a coffee, or just about anything to delay keeping at it and fighting through the discomfort.


### Conclusion 
Shifting your mindset to a growth mindset is essential if you aim to be successful in all aspects of your life -not just work!-. In the other hand, it will help you to be more satisfied with yourself, your efforts, your work, and your life, which leads to you becoming a happier person and your life easier.
