#### Terminology
* Broswer - software used to access the different websites.  
* Domain Name - a unique, human-readable internet 
addresses of a website.

* IP (Internet Protocol) Address - a unique numerical identifier that is assigned to a device 
to allow communication over the internet.
* Web Server - a special computer that hosts a website. 


#### How the web works 
1. People are connected to the internet via an **ISP** (Internet Service Provider). 
2. When a person wants to visit a website, they type the **domain name** (web address) of that website to their **browser**. 
3. The computer contacts a **domain name system** (DNS) 
server; which returns the **IP address** of the **web server** that hosts the website.
4. Your **browser** contacts the **web server**. 
4. The **web server** sends the page you requested back to your **web browser**.

The ** web browser** acctually receives HTML, CSS, JS, and other types of files from the **web server** that hosts the site. The **web browser** interprets the received code to create the page that you see.
