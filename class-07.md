## Domain Modeling

### Definition

*Domain modeling* is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.

An *object-oriented* model is an entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods.

A well articulated domain model can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem  among various stakeholders.
