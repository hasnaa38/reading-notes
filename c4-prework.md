### Common mistakes

1. The improper allocation of time.
Tip: make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

2. Trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.
Tip: Keep it simple.

### A simple set of steps to solve algorithm type programming problems

1. *Read the problem completely twice* - at least. You want to make sure you completely understand the problem. The better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.

2. *Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data* - at least. Programming is automating the things we do manually. It important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate.

    Solving the problem with at least three different inputs will help you make sure that:

    1. You really understand the solution.
    2. The solution will work for more than one case.

    Note: Don’t forget to look at special cases, for example corner and edge cases. Do examples for any kind of cases you can think of.

3. *Optimize the manual steps*. What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

4. *Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code*. This is done to outline the structure of the code we will write to solve the problem. However, this step can be skipped.

5. *Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code*.
6. *Optimize the real code*. Try to mainly simplify the code and get rid of any duplicates. 

Note: make sure to spend 70% of your time doing the first three steps.

Note: Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, use the “divide and conquer” method; find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then follow the steps above for each half. A good way to know where to break a problem in half is to think about what part of the problem if already given to you would make solving the rest easy.
