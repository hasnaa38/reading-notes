# Code 401 - Read 43 - Open-Source Software

## What is open-source software

software in which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.

Source code is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see. Programmers who have access to a source code can manipulate it to change how a program/application works.
Having the ability to access the source code of a program can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

## Why do people prefer using open source software?

1. **Control** - many people prefer open source software because they have more control over that kind of software. They can examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't want it to do, and they can change parts of it they don't like.

2. **Training** - being able to reach the source code for actual running programs can help developers to become better programmers. Because open source code is publicly accessible, students can easily study it as they learn to make better software. Students can also share their work with others, inviting comment and critique, as they develop their skills. When people discover mistakes in a source code, they can share those mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same mistakes themselves.

3. **Security** - some people prefer open source software because they consider it more secure and stable than proprietary software. Because anyone can view and modify open source software, someone might spot and correct errors or omissions that a program's original authors might have missed. And because so many programmers can work on a piece of open source software without asking for permission from original authors, they can fix, update, and upgrade open source software more quickly than they can proprietary software.

4. **Stability** - many users prefer open source software to proprietary software for important, long-term projects. Because programmers publicly distribute the source code for open source software, users relying on that software for critical tasks can be sure their tools won't disappear or fall into disrepair if their original creators stop working on them. Additionally, open source software tends to both incorporate and operate according to open standards.

5. **Community** - open source software often inspires a community of users and developers to form around it. That's not unique to open source; many popular applications are the subject of meetups and user groups. But in the case of open source, the community isn't just a fanbase that buys in (emotionally or financially) to an elite user group; it's the people who produce, test, use, promote, and ultimately affect the software they love.

## Does open source mean something is free of charge?

>> No. This is a common misconception about what "open source" implies, and the concept's implications are not only economic.

>> Open source software programmers can charge money for the open source software they create or to which they contribute. But in some cases, because an open source license might require them to release their source code when they sell software to others, some programmers find that charging users money for software services and support (rather than for the software itself) is more lucrative. This way, their software remains free of charge, and they make money helping others install, use, and troubleshoot it.

>> While some open source software may be free of charge, skill in programming and troubleshooting open source software can be quite valuable. Many employers specifically seek to hire programmers with experience working on open source software.
