1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? Personal computers became a thing, and those early personal computers weren't much more than toys. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? those games they were playing were marketed almost entirely to males, so the idea that computers are for boys became a narrative and females got excluded.

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

When they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

Studies imply that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones. And research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. Having a diverse developer team that represents all the desired users  will result in more efficient/inclusive services.
