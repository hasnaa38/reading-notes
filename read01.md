# read 01
This file contains a summary of read 01 - Learning Markdown. Throughout the document, a list that shows your progress in reading will be presented. 

#### *The first list:* 
- [ ] Markdown Language 
- [ ] GitHub Pages 

## Markdown Language 
This part summarizies [this](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) article. 


### what is markdown language? 
It is a way of styling text documents on the web, i.e, adding headings, formatting text (e.g: **bold** or *italic* words), creating ordered or unordered lists, or adding images, emojis, quotations, and hyperlinks. 

Markdown language is not a WYSIWYG, since it uses non-alphabetic characters along with the text to add features. For example, the word **bold** is bold because it was written between two `**` => `**bold**`

### testing 
GitHub uses its own version of the markdown syntax to provides more features that fit the content of their website. To test it, follow these steps: 
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one. 
2. Create a testing repository. 
3. Add a new file, make sure that it has that `.md` extension. 
4. Edit the file, add your text along with the syntax you want to test and review the changes. 
5. Commit changes if you want to save the file. 

Thats it! :relaxed:	

#### *The second list:*
- [x] Markdown Language 
- [ ] GitHub Pages 


## GitHub Pages 
This part summarizes [this](https://pages.github.com/) page. 

### what are GitHub pages? 
GitHub pages turn repositories into web pages to share the results directly with anyone, without the need of owning a domain, a server, or even knoweldge of html, css, or js. Actually, the page you are reading now is a GitHub page that I am currently writting at 6:58 pm - 28 April, 2021. 

### testing 
Follow these steps to create and share GitHub page for a document that looks like the one you are currently reading:  
1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one. 
2. Create a testing repository. 
3. Add a new file, make sure that it has `.md` extension. 
4. Edit the file, add your text along with the syntax you want to test and review the changes. 
5. Commit changes if you want to save the file. 
6. Open `settings` and navigate towards `Pages` option. 
7. Set the source of the page and save it. 
8. Copy the page link and share it! 

_**Note**_ using this link will open the default page, which is usually the README.md file. To share the link of another file, add its name at the end of the link withould the extension part.
