## Solving Programming Problems

### Common mistakes

1. The improper allocation of time.
Tip: make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.

2. Trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.
Tip: Keep it simple.

### A simple set of steps to solve algorithm type programming problems

1. *Read the problem completely twice* - at least. You want to make sure you completely understand the problem. The better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.

2. *Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data* - at least. Programming is automating the things we do manually. It important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate.

    Solving the problem with at least three different inputs will help you make sure that:

    1. You really understand the solution.
    2. The solution will work for more than one case.

    Note: Don’t forget to look at special cases, for example corner and edge cases. Do examples for any kind of cases you can think of.

3. *Optimize the manual steps*. What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

4. *Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code*. This is done to outline the structure of the code we will write to solve the problem. However, this step can be skipped.

5. *Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code*.
6. *Optimize the real code*. Try to mainly simplify the code and get rid of any duplicates.

Note: make sure to spend 70% of your time doing the first three steps.

Note: Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, use the “divide and conquer” method; find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then follow the steps above for each half. A good way to know where to break a problem in half is to think about what part of the problem if already given to you would make solving the rest easy.

## Act like you make $1000/hr

For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.

The way for gaining incredible productivity is by cultivating extreme focus with whatever you do.

Extreme focus helps you to get to the deep work state, which means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time.

This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time.


## How to think like a programmer

Thinking like a programmer is all about effective problem solving. The best problem solving ways involve a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

### Having a framework

When you encounter a new problem:

1. *Understand it*. Know exactly what is being asked.
How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

2. *Plan*. give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information, then write down the exact steps you came up with.

3. *Divide*. Brake big problem into sub-problems. Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots. Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.

4. *Stuck?* try the following:

    1. Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
    2. Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
    Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
    3. Research: No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it.

### Practicing

If you want to be a good problem-solver, practice that by solving a lot of problems!

## The 5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

[Article Link](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

The 5 Whys technique is a simple but powerful tool for cutting quickly through the outward symptoms of a problem to reveal its underlying causes, so that you can deal with it once and for all.

To use the 5 whys technique, follows this simple seven-step process:

1. Assemble a team of people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.

2. Define the problem and discuss it with your team. Write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"

3. Ask your team why the problem is occurring. Search for answers that are grounded in fact, they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.
Your team members may come up with one obvious reason why, or several plausible ones. Record their answers as succinct phrases, rather than as single words or lengthy statements, and write them below your problem statement.

4. Ask "Why?" four more times for each of the answers that you generated in step 3.

5. Know when to stop. When asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further, you've revealed the root cause of the problem.
If you identified more than one reason in step 3, repeat this process for each of the different branches of your analysis until you reach a root cause for each one.

6. Address the root cause(s) and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

7. Monitor your measures. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely.
